# Hamming-Distance
Hamming Distance is another slightly different variation on the distance formula. Instead of finding the difference of each dimension, Hamming distance only cares about whether the dimensions are exactly equal. When finding the Hamming distance between two points, add one for every dimension that has different values.

Hamming distance is used in spell checking algorithms. For example, the Hamming distance between the word “there” and the typo “thete” is one. Each letter is a dimension, and each dimension has the same value except for one.
